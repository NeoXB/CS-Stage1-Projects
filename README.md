# CS-Stage1-Projects

In this repository, there are 3 main projects:
> Snake-project-C-1.py
  - A modern take on the classic snake game where you will verse a computer instead of playing solo.
> VIRUS_PART_A (Nicholas Tony - nton939).py
  - A program that simulates the spread of viruses through contact.
> Creatures.py
  - A program that simulates the movements of different ‘creatures’ that are defined in text files.
  - 'Creatures' folder stores all the different creatures.
  - world_input.txt defines the virtual world for the creatures to move around.
  - nton939.pdf contains my review on the project (in terms of what I did, what I learnt and what I found difficult) and a brief               description for some of the creatures.
